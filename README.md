Pokedex App
Overview
The Pokedex App is a full-stack CRUD application designed to interact with the Pokemon API (PokAPI) and provide a comprehensive Pokedex experience. Built with Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize for database interaction, and following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, this application allows users to create, read, update, and delete information about various Pokemon, including details such as stats, health, type, and more.

Features
MVC Architecture: The project is structured following the MVC design pattern for a modular and organized codebase. This ensures a clear separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend the application.

Pokemon API Integration: The Pokedex App is connected to the Pokemon API (PokAPI) to fetch and display detailed information about different Pokemon species.

Sequelize Database: The application uses Sequelize, an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library, to connect to a database. This facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of Pokemon information, including stats, health, type, etc.

CRUD Operations: Users can perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on Pokemon entries. This provides a dynamic and interactive experience for managing Pokedex data.

JSON Format: The data exchanged between the frontend and backend is in JSON format, ensuring a consistent and standardized communication protocol.
